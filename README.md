# Deduction-of-subjective-remarks-to-statistical-equivalence-by-sentiment-analysis
Sentimental Analysis
This work is intended to aim at textual analysis of subjective/sentimental remarks and infer their statistical equivalence. This proposal considers comments made on and stars rated to online product purchases made by users in Amazon. Amazon data are pursued especially since they are abundantly available for Amazon product reviews, although this implementation can be extended to any instance of this paradigm.

The goal of the project is to predict the rating of a product based on reviews, so that a user can decide whether to buy the product or not just looking at ratings instead of reading all the reviews. For the implementation, Amazon Fine Food Review Dataset is used. The dataset consists of about 568,454 reviews. The project can be used to any dataset which involves user reviews and can predict its ratings.

Languages and tools used: Python, MS Excel and Tableau.
